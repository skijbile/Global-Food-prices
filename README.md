# Global Food Prices- Collaborative project 

	To work with a partner and learn how to strategize and find techniques that help us work as a team, allowing us to understand the challenges and upsides of working in a team setting. Improve on communication and management skills to submit and complete everything in a timely manner. Finally, work with concepts previously learnt to further understand and improve, with the goal of strengthening the foundation of these skills.

#Process
	
	Finding the right data to work with was a challenge, as we were just finishing up one project and moving to the other we decided it was best to use a data which was easier to use, so after a lot of research we selected a data from kaggle, link is as follows- https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jboysen/global-food-prices .This data talks about the commodity prices in over 70 countries. 
	We thought it was best to divide the tasks in between us to make the most of the way our schedules were so we prepared a timeline and set goals. First step was the cleaning and EDA process, which you can find in the EDA.ipnyb notebook in the notebooks folder. Second step was to create the statistical models using python and you can find these details in modelling.ipynb.
	The last step was to create the visuals and dashboard for our data set to answer the questions as follows :
		1) The trend in change of price for various commodities in the different countries 
		2) To see if there change in commodity price withing the various regions within the same country ? 


#Results

	Overview Dashboard- gives us a quick insight into the data set, the countries it covers , how many countries and commodities are available and the types of markets these commodities sell in.

	Change in Prices Dashboard- this gives us the trend in the prices over the years for a selected commodity and allows us to select the country where the commodity is available. We can see the percentage rise/fall in cost of the price in comparision to the previous year. This could be possibly used to compare the inflation rate with the current time.

	 Market Analysis in Ukraine Dashboard- here we can see the different prices within the different market regions in Ukraine. How the same commodity within the country the price varies, this may be due to multiple factors. We tried to see if there was a pattern in the change in price due to the war situation in the year 2014 but the data is not sufficient to make any such predictions.

#Challenges

	With 2 people being involved, time-management was definately the biggest challenge to make sure each part was completed by the respective person so that the next steps were not hindered. With the limited time we had to complete the project, and our scheduling conflicts, it was hard to find a time where we were both available to work on the project simultaneously. Finding data that would interest both of us was the next big task. Creating the statistical model was quite difficult since our data was mostly categorical, it was difficult to find a model that was best suited for the relationship we wanted to explore and describe. 
	Coordinating and being able to push the updates of the project to the remote repository was challenging to make sure there is no merge conflicts and that all the branches are updated so that we both are able to do our parts on a timely manner.

 #Improvements

 	Find missing data to get a better sense of the inflation.
